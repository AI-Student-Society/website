AI2S is a nonprofit association founded by students of the [Data Science and Scientific Computing Master Degree](https://dssc.units.it/) at the University of Trieste, Italy. Our aim is to organize and promote initiatives about Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, and to collaborate with other institutions to create a tight-knit community working on these topics.

This site is currently under construction. We are planning some awesome launch events that will take place next month, stay tuned! :smile:
